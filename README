Huge thanks to george for http://www.mr-webcam.com/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=58&sid=003347d7d6aee967af207b067b2e6506 : 

That post is where this script is born!

This script is some kind of dirty hack allowing us to save time for the installation of php on Blueonyx.
It works for us on a fresh install (updated); but I've no guarantees whatsoever that it will for you.
Run this script at your own risks, you are the only culprit if anything goes wrong!
Even worse, some things go wrong and we know it! like when I change url fopen or url include in blueonyx's 
config, they don't appeared change in the php info.

How this script works:
0. I usually just do everything as root here (shivers) and chown to apache when done.
1. Setup the variables in the Variables section
2. The scripts requires ONE parameter to run; this is to ensure people read before they run; possible parameters are:
	compile : installs the dev dependencies, downloads the indicated version, compiles it, and prepares an archive with your php (about 43Mb)
		  Keep it mind you should compile on another machine than the server so dev tools are not available to an attacker in case your server is compromised.
	install : meant to be run with the archive !!! in the server's /home/ directory !!! ; uncompresses it and installs it on the server (yes /home/ is static so far... Sorry bout that)
	enableone : enables the new php for one specific site
	enableall : enables the new php in all sites (I'm not sure I would try this option in production yet)
	disableone : disables the new php in one specific site
	menu : enables the menu


Changelog
v0.01 - First alpha
v0.02 - Simplified variables input
	- Added dynamic version change in case different versions are required (only at script startup)
	- Added the menu
v0.03 - Cheers to Achel to find pecl doesn't like "php" in the path, corrected in this version
	- go-pear was unsecure cause it needed a / in basedir to edit /root/pearrc when installing as root - Kinda fixed this with some sudo process:
	  !!! The script needs one extra existing user !!! (create it in http://your.blueonyx.local:444 and then set this in the variables 
	  !That user needs enough quota to compile!)
	- Added check to prevent downloading php each time the script compiles
	- Added check to prevent overwriting a previously compiled version
	- Implemented some sed parsing for temporarly setting / in php.ini's basedir (no choice)
v0.04 - Minor changes/corrections for switch to php 5.3.4
	- Works for 5.3.5 also
v0.05 - Works with php-5.3.6
      - Implemented better support for pecl extensions
